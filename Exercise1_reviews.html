                <h3>Rating - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                <h3>Review - </h3>
                <p>J.K. Rowling's debut novel, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (known as "Sorcerer's Stone"
                    in the US), introduces readers to a magical world that has captivated audiences for decades. The
                    story follows Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a
                    wizard. Whisked away from his neglectful aunt and uncle, Harry enters the hidden world of Hogwarts
                    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Rowling's vivid imagination brings to life a richly detailed
                    magical universe, complete with its own history, customs, and quirky characters. The book cleverly
                    blends elements of fantasy, mystery, and coming-of-age tales, appealing to readers of all ages. As
                    Harry navigates his new life, he forms close friendships with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger,
                    faces the challenges of magical education, and uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths and his
                    connection to the dark wizard Voldemort. The plot builds to an exciting climax as Harry and his
                    friends confront danger and evil, showcasing themes of courage, friendship, and the power of love.
                    While the writing style is straightforward and accessible for younger readers, Rowling weaves in
                    enough complexity and hints at a larger narrative to keep older audiences engaged. The book's
                    success lies in its ability to create a sense of wonder and possibility, inviting readers to imagine
                    themselves in this magical world. "Philosopher's Stone" sets the foundation for a series that would
                    go on to become a cultural phenomenon, introducing beloved characters and magical concepts that
                    continue to enchant new generations of readers.</p>

                <p>France, 1916. Europe is riven by two years of mechanised slaughter in the Great War. Hundreds of
                    miles of muddy trenches and chemically-polluted wasteland run from the North Sea to Switzerland.
                    Here at the southern border, so-called Kilometre Zero is quiet. The enlisted men are too cold and
                    tired to pursue valour, the officers too wary of upsetting their neutral Swiss neighbours. Both
                    French and German forces are content to huddle by their fires and let their comrades fight it out
                    further up the line.

                    But something is upsetting the silent, snowy peace of Kilometre Zero. Livestock are found mutilated,
                    a night patrol suffers a grisly encounter, and a captured German deserter carries a dire warning. As
                    the full moon rises above the Jura Mountains, American legionnaire Sam Carter and British officer
                    Lucas Avery once again find themselves drawn into battle with a supernatural evil...</p>

                <p>What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's
                    answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient
                    tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.

                    Humorous, surprising, and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must
                    be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always
                    pet a cat when you meet one on the street.

                    What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with
                    our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay
                    careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become
                    resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom,
                    adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules
                    for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature
                    while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.</p>

                <h3>Rating - ⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                <h3>Review - </h3>
                <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a personal finance book written by Robert Kiyosaki. The book was first
                    published in 1997 and has since become a bestseller, with over 40 million copies sold worldwide. The
                    book is written in a conversational tone and is aimed at anyone looking to gain financial literacy
                    and independence.

                    The book is divided into ten chapters, each of which focuses on a different aspect of personal
                    finance. The author begins by introducing the two main characters in the book, his "rich dad" and
                    his "poor dad." The "rich dad" is the father of his best friend, who is a successful entrepreneur
                    and investor, while the "poor dad" is his own biological father, who is an educated man but
                    struggles financially.

                    Throughout the book, the author draws on the lessons he learned from both his "rich dad" and "poor
                    dad" to offer practical advice on how to achieve financial success. He discusses topics such as the
                    importance of financial education, the difference between assets and liabilities, and the power of
                    passive income.

                    One of the book's main themes is financial literacy's importance. The author argues that many people
                    struggle financially because they lack the basic knowledge necessary to manage their money
                    effectively. He encourages readers to take an active role in their financial education and to seek
                    out resources that can help them learn more about personal finance.

                    A key concept highlighted in the book is the distinction between assets and liabilities. As per the
                    author's definition, assets refer to anything that generates income or adds value to your finances,
                    whereas liabilities are anything that incurs expenses or reduces your net worth. He encourages
                    readers to focus on acquiring assets and minimizing their liabilities, as this is the key to
                    building wealth.</p>

                    Growing up in a small rice-farming village in 1980s Iran, eleven-year-old Saba Hafezi and her twin
                    sister, Mahtab, are captivated by America. They keep lists of English words and collect illegal Life
                    magazines, television shows, and rock music. So when her mother and sister disappear, leaving Saba
                    and her father alone in Iran, Saba is certain that they have moved to America without her. But her
                    parents have taught her that “all fate is written in the blood,” and that twins will live the same
                    life, even if separated by land and sea. As she grows up in the warmth and community of her local
                    village, falls in and out of love, and struggles with the limited possibilities in
                    post-revolutionary Iran, Saba envisions that there is another way for her story to unfold.
                    Somewhere, it must be that her sister is living the Western version of this life. And where Saba’s
                    world has all the grit and brutality of real life under the new Islamic regime, her sister’s
                    experience gives her a freedom and control that Saba can only dream of.

                <p>
                    Carlo Ancelotti's "Quiet Leadership" offers a refreshing perspective on management in the
                    high-pressure world of professional football. Drawing from his extensive experience as a player and
                    coach at elite clubs, Ancelotti presents a leadership philosophy that emphasizes calm, respect, and
                    emotional intelligence over authoritarian tactics. The book provides insights into Ancelotti's
                    approach to handling star players, navigating club politics, and maintaining composure in the face
                    of intense media scrutiny. Ancelotti's anecdotes from his time at clubs like AC Milan, Chelsea, and
                    Real Madrid illustrate his principles in action, offering readers a behind-the-scenes look at
                    top-level football management. He stresses the importance of adaptability, clear communication, and
                    creating a positive team culture. The author's humble and reflective tone adds credibility to his
                    advice, as he openly discusses both successes and failures. While the book is primarily focused on
                    football, many of Ancelotti's leadership lessons are applicable to management in other fields. He
                    emphasizes the value of listening, empathy, and building trust with team members. The book's
                    structure, alternating between personal stories and leadership lessons, makes for an engaging read.
                    However, some readers might find certain sections repetitive or wish for more in-depth tactical
                    analysis. Overall, "Quiet Leadership" offers a valuable perspective on effective management in
                    high-stakes environments, presenting a thoughtful alternative to more aggressive leadership styles
                    often associated with successful coaches. It's a must-read for football enthusiasts and
                    aspiring leaders alike.

                <p>
                    "Wings of Fire," the autobiography of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, co-authored with Arun Tiwari, is a
                    compelling narrative that traces the journey of a humble boy from Rameswaram to becoming India's
                    "Missile Man" and eventually the country's 11th President. The book, divided into four sections,
                    offers a candid and inspiring account of Kalam's life, blending personal anecdotes with India's
                    scientific and technological progress. Kalam's writing style is simple yet profound, making complex
                    scientific concepts accessible to the general reader. He vividly describes his childhood, the
                    influence of his parents and teachers, and his early career at DRDO and ISRO. The narrative
                    skillfully intertwines Kalam's personal growth with India's emerging space and defense programs,
                    offering unique insights into the challenges and triumphs of Indian science. Kalam's unwavering
                    patriotism, his vision for India's technological self-reliance, and his emphasis on the power of
                    dreams and perseverance shine throughout the book. He doesn't shy away from discussing failures and
                    setbacks, presenting them as stepping stones to success. The book's title metaphorically represents
                    Kalam's rise from humble beginnings, much like a rocket launching into space. While some readers
                    might find certain technical details challenging, the overall narrative remains engaging and
                    inspirational. "Wings of Fire" is more than just an autobiography; it's a testament to the power of
                    education, hard work, and visionary thinking. It continues to inspire generations of Indians,
                    especially youth, to dream big and contribute to nation-building, making it a timeless classic in
                    Indian literature

                <h3>Rating - ⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                <h3>Review - </h3>
                <p>
                    Fredrik Backman's "A Man Called Ove" is a heartwarming and humorous tale that explores the depths of
                    human connection and the power of community. The novel introduces us to Ove, a curmudgeonly
                    59-year-old widower whose gruff exterior masks a heart broken by loss and a life shaped by
                    principles of order and routine. As the story unfolds, Backman skillfully peels back the layers of
                    Ove's character, revealing a complex man whose rigidity is challenged by the chaos of his vibrant,
                    multicultural neighbors.
                    The narrative alternates between Ove's present-day interactions and flashbacks to his past,
                    gradually unveiling the experiences that molded him. This structure allows readers to understand and
                    empathize with Ove, even as his cantankerous behavior initially repels those around him. Backman's
                    writing shines in its ability to find humor in everyday situations while tackling serious themes of
                    grief, loneliness, and the search for purpose in life.
                    As Ove reluctantly becomes entangled in his neighbors' lives, the story evolves into a beautiful
                    exploration of how community can heal and transform even the most isolated individuals. The
                    supporting characters are well-drawn and diverse, each bringing their own quirks and challenges that
                    ultimately enrich Ove's life.
                    Backman's prose is simple yet evocative, infused with dry wit and moments of profound emotion. While
                    the plot may occasionally veer into sentimentality, the author's genuine affection for his
                    characters keeps the story grounded and relatable.
                    "A Man Called Ove" is a touching, funny, and ultimately life-affirming novel that reminds us of the
                    importance of human connection and the unexpected joys that can arise from opening our
                    hearts to others.

                    Flora Mancini has been happily married for more than twenty years. But everything she thought she
                    knew about herself, her marriage, and her relationship with her best friend, Margot, is upended when

                    Flora and Julian struggled for years, scraping together just enough acting work to raise Ruby in
                    Manhattan and keep Julian’s small theater company—Good Company—afloat. A move to Los Angeles brought

                    No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving—every day. James Clear,
                    one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach
                    you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to
                    remarkable results.

                    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system.
                    Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you
                    have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level
                    of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

                    Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily
                    applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology,
                    and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad
                    habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from
                    Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star
                    comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of
                    their field.

                    Learn how to:
                    - Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);
                    - Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;
                    - Design your environment to make success easier;
                    - Get back on track when you fall off course;
                    ...and much more.

                    Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and
                    strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship,
                    an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking,
                    lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.
